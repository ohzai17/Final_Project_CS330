Read through Beej's guide to network programming. There are multiple examples of basic client/server programs in C/C++ for both TCP and UDP. Write a network client/server based application of your choice in C/C++ using either TCP or UDP as your transport layer protocol. Indicate why you chose the one over the other in your header comments.

Example applications may include:

Instant messaging chat application
text based client/server game
Chat interaction with AI server over TCP|UDP/IP socket not web api
Convert dining philosophers program to network based
This does not have to be super elaborate, just provide some sort of network communication functionality between the client and server and perform a useful function beyond just sending 'hello world' between the two nodes. You may use either multiple networked computers or run both programs over the local loopback address of 127.0.0.1 on your local system.
